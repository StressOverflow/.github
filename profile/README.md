[StressOverflow] is a student group from the [Universidad Rey Juan Carlos] 🎓. Formed by [Diego García], [Teresa Ortega], [Carlos Escarcena] and [Arantxa García]

![team](https://github.com/StressOverflow/.github/assets/92941081/22fc3c0a-faa4-44b2-b86f-3aca8dee8915)

What began as a [group of practices for a particular subject](https://github.com/Docencia-fmrico) from our grade, ended up forming a brave and capable team willing to contribute to the robotics industry as best as possible. 🦾

Here you will find everything we do, mainly developing packages and final applications for [ROS 2 🐢](https://www.ros.org/). 

We hope you like it and find it useful! 😊

C ya!
