[StressOverflow] is a student group from the [Universidad Rey Juan Carlos]. Formed by [Diego García], [Teresa Ortega], [Carlos Escarcena] and [Arantxa García]

![team](https://github.com/StressOverflow/.github/assets/92941081/22fc3c0a-faa4-44b2-b86f-3aca8dee8915)

What began as a [group of practices for a particular subject](https://github.com/Docencia-fmrico) ended up forming a brave and capable team willing to contribute to the robotics industry as best as possible.

Here you will find everything we do, mainly developing packages and final applications for [ROS 2](https://www.ros.org/).

We hope you like it and find it useful!

C ya!
